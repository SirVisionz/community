# Introduction

The Prologue is a special chapter within the game that must be played before any other chapters. Upon it's first playthrough (in "tutorial mode"), it will teach the player the basic mechanics of the game as the story progresses. It is the job of the prologue to set the stage for the protagonist and create a platform for self contained stories within the larger universe, told by the community over time.

# Opening Seqeunce

The party is locked inside a featureless room adorned only with the "Alpha Corporation" logo. A directional light turns on and scans them. After a moment an alarm goes off with a computer voice alerting to a defective unit. The computer voice indicates it will begin the decontamination routine.

Before the decontamination routine can complete, a Janitor tumbles into the room from above and interrupts. It reassures the party to not pay any attention to what the computer is saying and to trust it. The Janitor interfaces with the door and opens it part way, allowing the party out into the corridor. *The player will need to **CROUCH** in order to get under the half-opened door.*

# The Corridor

In the corridor, the alarms are continuing to go off. The Janitor notes that all the exits are locked and that the route out of the building will need to be a bit more creative. This will be the first fork where one path will include a tutorial before advancing the story further.

# Path 1

## The Hatch

The Janitor notes to the player that there seems to be a crate over in the corner and thinks they could jump on top of it in order to access the access hatch on the ceiling.

*The player will need to **JUMP** in order to get on top of the crate.* Once on top of the crate, the Janitor will instruct the player on how to open the hatch. *The player will need to **INTERACT** in order to open the hatch.* With the hatch open, the player can get inside where they are whisked off to another area.

## The Maintenance Shaft

The Janitor follows rattles down the shaft and hits the floor. It "picks" itself up and looks around while apologising for the rough ride. The player is in a dimly lit but large open room with run down equipment. A light shines from an opening approximately 20m up the opposing wall. The Janitor explains that you'll need to climb up there to start getting back to where you're supposed to be. *The player will be able to move around freely in the room to get used to their movement, but will need to **SPECIAL** to climb the wall in order to get to the next room.*

# Path 2

## The Elevator Shaft

The Janitor proclaims there's no time to explain and indicates the party should proceed directly to the armoury one floor down. It flies over to an elevator panel and opens the doors, explaining that waiting for the elevator would take too long and that the party should just jump down the shaft.

*The shaft should consist of a fairly easy traversal challenge, where the door opens into the shaft, and a highly illuminated opening one level down is available to cross into. It is expected that the player only needs to allow themselves to drop and then **BOOST** into the opening.*

## The Armoury

The Janitor leads the party down a corridor and opens a door leading to an armoury. The party is given the opportunity to get their first resupply here. While this is happening the Janitor appears to become increasingly anxious until it exclaims that the Alpha Corporation AI has already found them and they should get a move on. It reopens the door and goes back into the corridor.
